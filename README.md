# Bulgarian Language App

This is a web application for learning bulgarian language.

It will be implemented using tools from python as well as NLP tools for breaking down a language which I don't initially understand. Therefore, the whole process will also have to involve learning a whole new language - which I am motivated to do, so that I can speak my girlfriends native tongue.

Moreover, I will heavily rely on using chatGPT. This is a test of how far and how fast I can reach goals using this tool.
